This project focuses on the alaysis and exploration of the Loan Anime Data set.

## About the Data Set ðŸ“‘
Data set is taken from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-anime-dataset-2024
- *Attributes :* 22 features

   - used several common strategies to handle null values in a dataset such as droping columns or rows, imputation which includes replacing missing numerical values with the 
     mean, median, or mode of the column.

 2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* ðŸ“ˆ
   - Conducted thorough EDA to gain insights into the distribution of features, relationships, and patterns within the cleaned data.
   - Visualized the features to get some key insights and identify patterns within the data ->
